# Rice Gain Counting
The rice grain counting system utilizes Computer Vision techniques such as OpenCV, Watershed
Algorithm, Image Pre-processing, and Image Segmentation. The objective is to optimize the 
provided image for accurate counting of rice grains. Clear and well-separated rice grains from the 
background result in easier counting.
Objective 1: Count the number of rice grains in the Image.
Objective 2: Find the number of broken grains in the image.

# There are a total 3 major and challenging parts in building solutions:

1. Image Preprocessing
2. Solving Grains touching problem
3. Counting broken rice
